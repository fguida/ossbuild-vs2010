GstRTSP is an RTSP server built on top of GStreamer (http://gstreamer.net).

Currently there is no configuration tools for this server so any streamed 
files need to be hardcoded into the file:
src/rtsp-media.c

Edit in your sources after the examples found under the section headlines by
* STREAMING CONFIGURATION

Once the server is started you should be able to view the streams at:
rtsp://localhost:1554/@name_of_stream@

The replacement for @name_of_stream@ is from the rtsp-media.c editing you did above.

You should be able to get the http proxy link working without any editing of the rtsp-media.c file as it points to an online http file:

rtsp://localhost:1554/rtphttpproxy
